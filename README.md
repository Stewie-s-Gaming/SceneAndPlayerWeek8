# SceneAndPlayerWeek8

In this game we completed two assignments:

1) Scene and modeling:

* We created an office with furniture.
* Corridor which leads to the office.
* We added light to the office (with a switch to turn it on and off).
* We added a staircase that leads to our office from the main building.


2) Player - Interaction:

* We put a treasure chest inside the office, in order to open it PRESS E and in order to collect ("loot") the prize PRESS Z. (Need to stand next to the chest)
* We added a switch to the light, when you are standing close to it PRESS E to flip the switch on/off.
* We emplaced a NPC in the office, when you stand next to it - a message appears above him which instructs the player what to next and how. PRESS E to navigate between the messages.
